# Shower Arguments

The comeback you thought of 3 hours later.

For those moments when someone said something wrong, you froze, and now you're replaying the conversation in the shower with much better dialogue.

## The Problem

Someone was wrong. You knew they were wrong. But in the moment, your brain went blank and you just stood there. Now it's 3 AM and you've finally thought of the perfect response.

## The Solution

Tell us what happened. We'll generate the devastating comeback you deserved.

## How It Works

1. Describe the argument you should have won
2. Our algorithm analyzes the audacity
3. Get the perfect comeback(s)
4. Peace of mind (hopefully)

## Comeback Categories

- **Intellectual**: For when they tried to sound smart
- **Calm Devastating**: Kill them with kindness (and precision)
- **Witty**: Sharp, quick, memorable
- **Philosophical**: Make them question their life choices
- **Professional**: Corporate-safe destruction
- **Exhausted But Correct**: When you're too tired but still right

## Sample Outputs

> "I'm sure that sounded smarter in your head."

> "Somewhere out there is a tree tirelessly producing oxygen for you. You owe it an apology."

> "The confidence with which you're wrong is almost admirable."

> "Per the evidence you clearly didn't review..."

## Run It

```bash
pip install flask
python app.py
# Open http://localhost:5013
```

## Pro Tips Included

Each response comes with delivery advice:
- "The key is to say this and then immediately change the subject."
- "Maintain eye contact. Don't blink. They'll blink first."
- "Say this, then take a sip of your drink like you're in a movie."

## Why This Exists

Because closure is a myth but fake closure is available on demand.
